Assignments for [Berkeley CS 285: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Decision Making, and Control](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/).

I've added all the setup steps into a Dockerfile, so you dont have to grind through the installation steps and get to the juicy stuff.

Instructions
1. Install docker
2. `cd` here
3. `docker build . -t bkly_cs285` -- does the installation and build for you, WIP
4. `docker run -it bkly_cs285`

Also I am collating solutions from people! Nothing personal folks, y'all were just the first people on the forks list. Credits to:
